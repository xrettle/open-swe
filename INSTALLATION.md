# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Open SWE end-to-end: local development, GitHub App creation, LangSmith configuration, webhooks, and production deployment.

> **The steps are ordered to avoid forward references.** Each step only depends on things you've already completed.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11 – 3.13** (3.14 is not yet supported due to dependency constraints)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/cli/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for local development — exposes webhook endpoints to the internet)

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe.git
cd open-swe
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras
```

## 2. Start ngrok

You'll need the ngrok URL in subsequent steps when configuring webhooks, so start it first.

```bash
ngrok http 2024 --url https://some-url-you-configure.ngrok.dev
```

You don't need to pass the `--url` flag, however doing so will use the same subdomain each time you startup the server. Without this, you'll need to update the webhook URL in GitHub, Slack and Linear every time you restart your server for local development.

Copy the HTTPS URL you set, or if you didn't pass `--url`, the one ngrok gives you. You'll paste this into the webhook settings in steps 3 and 5.

> Keep this terminal open — ngrok needs to stay running during local development. Use a second terminal for the rest of the steps.

## 3. Create a GitHub App

Open SWE authenticates as a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps) to clone repos, push branches, and open PRs.

### 3a. Choose your OAuth provider ID

Before creating the app you need to decide on an **OAuth provider ID** — this is a short string you'll use in both GitHub and LangSmith to link the two. Pick something memorable, for example:

```
your-org-github-oauth
```

Write this down. You'll use it in the callback URL below and again in step 4 when configuring LangSmith.

### 3b. Create the app

1. Go to **GitHub Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**
2. Fill in:
   - **App name**: `open-swe` (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: This can be any valid URL — it's only shown on the GitHub Marketplace page (which you won't be using). Use something like `https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe`
   - **Callback URL**: `https://smith.langchain.com/host-oauth-callback/<your-provider-id>` — replace `<your-provider-id>` with the ID you chose in step 3a (e.g. `https://smith.langchain.com/host-oauth-callback/your-org-github-oauth`)
   - **Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation**: ✅ Enable this
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/github` — use the ngrok URL from step 2
   - **Webhook secret**: generate one and save it — you'll need it later as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```
3. Set permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - Contents: Read & write
     - Pull requests: Read & write
     - Issues: Read & write
     - Metadata: Read-only
4. Under **Subscribe to events**, enable:
   - `Issue comment`
   - `Pull request review`
   - `Pull request review comment`
5. Click **Create GitHub App**

### 3c. Collect credentials

After creating the app:

1. **App ID** — shown at the top of the app's settings page. Save this as `GITHUB_APP_ID`.
2. **Private key** — scroll down to **Private keys** → click **Generate a private key**. A `.pem` file will download. Save its contents as `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

### 3d. Install the app on your repositories

1. From your app's settings page, click **Install App** in the sidebar
2. Select your org or personal account
3. Choose which repositories Open SWE should have access to
4. Click **Install**
5. After installation, look at the URL in your browser — it will look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678
   ```
   or for an org:
   ```
   https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/installations/12345678
   ```
   The number at the end (`12345678`) is your **Installation ID**. Save this as `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`.

> **Note**: The installation page may prompt you to authenticate with LangSmith. If you haven't set up LangSmith yet (step 4), that's fine — you can still grab the Installation ID from the URL and complete the OAuth setup later.

## 4. Set up LangSmith

Open SWE uses [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for:
- **Tracing**: all agent runs are logged for debugging and observability
- **Sandboxes**: each task runs in an isolated LangSmith cloud sandbox

### 4a. Get your API key, project and tenant IDs

1. Create a [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) if you don't have one
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create API Key**
3. Save it as `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD`
4. Get your **Tenant ID**: Visit LangSmith, login, then copy the UUID in the URL. Example: if your URL is `https://smith.langchain.com/o/72184268-01ea-4d29-98cc-6cfcf0f2abb0/agents/chat` -> the tenant ID would be `72184268-01ea-4d29-98cc-6cfcf0f2abb0`. Save it as `LANGSMITH_TENANT_ID_PROD`.
5. Get your **Project ID**: open your tracing project in LangSmith, then click on the **ID** button in the top left, directly next to the project name. Save it as `LANGSMITH_TRACING_PROJECT_ID_PROD`

### 4b. Configure GitHub OAuth (optional but recommended)

This lets each user authenticate with their own GitHub account. Without it, all operations use the GitHub App's installation token (a shared bot identity).

**What this affects:**
- **With per-user OAuth**: PRs and commits show the triggering user's identity; each user's GitHub permissions are respected
- **Without it (bot-token-only mode)**: all PRs and commits appear as the GitHub App bot; the app's installation-level permissions are used for everything

To set up per-user OAuth:

1. In LangSmith, go to **Settings → OAuth Providers → Add Provider**
2. Set the **Provider ID** to the same string you chose in step 3a (e.g. `your-org-github-oauth`)
3. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your GitHub App (found on the GitHub App settings page under **OAuth credentials**)
4. Enter the **Authorization URL** as `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` and the **Token URL** as `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`.
5. Leave "Enable PKCE" unchecked.
6. Save. You'll reference this Provider ID as `GITHUB_OAUTH_PROVIDER_ID` in your environment variables.

### 4c. Sandbox snapshots

LangSmith sandboxes provide the isolated execution environment for each agent run. Open SWE boots each sandbox from a pre-built **snapshot** — you build the snapshot once (from a Docker image) and then reference it by UUID.

(Optional) Build and Push a custom Docker Image to Docker hub
First build and push the sandbox Docker image to a registry LangSmith can pull from. On Apple Silicon, force `linux/amd64`

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t <your-docker-hub>/<name-of-your-image> \
  --push .
```

For a multi-arch tag that also runs locally on Apple Silicon:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t <your-docker-hub>/<name-of-your-image> \
  --push .
```

Then build a snapshot in the LangSmith UI (Sandboxes → Snapshots → New), or via the SDK:

```python
from langsmith.sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient(api_key="<your key>")
snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
    name="open-swe",
    docker_image="johanneslangchain/open-swe-sandbox:gh-cli-amd64",  # built from ./Dockerfile
    fs_capacity_bytes=32 * 1024**3,
)
print(snapshot.id)
```

You can also use the helper script:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_sandbox_snapshot.py \
  --name open-swe-gh-cli-amd64 \
  --image johanneslangchain/open-swe-sandbox:gh-cli-amd64
```

Then set the resulting UUID in your environment:

```bash
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID="<snapshot-uuid>"
# Optional; overrides the snapshot's root FS size at sandbox boot. Default is 32 GiB.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_FS_CAPACITY_BYTES="34359738368"
# Optional; number of vCPUs per sandbox. Default is 4.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_VCPUS="4"
# Optional; memory in bytes per sandbox. Default is 15 GiB.
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MEM_BYTES="16106127360"
```

`DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID` is required when `SANDBOX_TYPE=langsmith`. The server validates this at startup and refuses to boot if it's missing. The snapshot should include the GitHub CLI from the project Dockerfile; Open SWE authenticates `git` and `gh` through the LangSmith sandbox proxy using runtime-minted GitHub App installation tokens, not deployment-stored GitHub access tokens.

## 5. Set up triggers

Open SWE can be triggered from GitHub, Linear, and/or Slack. **Configure whichever surfaces your team uses — you don't need all of them.**

### GitHub

GitHub triggering works automatically once your GitHub App is set up (step 3). Users can:
- Tag `@openswe` in issue titles or bodies to start a task
- Tag `@openswe` in issue comments for follow-up instructions
- Tag `@openswe` in PR review comments to have it address review feedback

To control which GitHub users can trigger the agent, add them to the `GITHUB_USER_EMAIL_MAP` in `agent/utils/github_user_email_map.py`:

```python
GITHUB_USER_EMAIL_MAP = {
    "their-github-username": "their-email@example.com",
}
```

You should also add the GitHub organization which should be allowed to be triggered from in GitHub:

`agent/webapp.py`
```python
ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS = "langchain-ai,anthropics"
```

### Linear (optional)

Open SWE listens for Linear comments that mention `@openswe`.

**Create a webhook:**

1. In Linear, go to **Settings → API → Webhooks → New webhook**
2. Fill in:
   - **Label**: `open-swe`
   - **URL**: `https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/linear` — use the ngrok URL from step 2
   - **Secret**: generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` — save this as `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Under **Data change events**, enable **Comments → Create** only
4. Click **Create webhook**

**Get your API key:**

1. Go to **Settings → API → Personal API keys → New API key**
2. Name it `open-swe`, select **All access**, and copy the key
3. Save it as `LINEAR_API_KEY`

**Configure team-to-repo mapping:**

Open SWE routes Linear issues to GitHub repos based on the Linear team and project. Edit the mapping in `agent/utils/linear_team_repo_map.py`:

```python
LINEAR_TEAM_TO_REPO = {
    "My Team": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "my-repo"},
    "Engineering": {
        "projects": {
            "backend": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "backend"},
            "frontend": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "frontend"},
        },
        "default": {"owner": "my-org", "name": "monorepo"},
    },
}
```

Users can also override the team/project mapping per-comment by including `repo:owner/name` (or a GitHub URL) in their `@openswe` comment. The mapping is used as a fallback when no repo is specified in the comment text.

### Slack (optional)

**Create a Slack App:**

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From a manifest**
2. Copy the manifest below, replacing the two placeholder URLs:
   - Replace `<your-provider-id>` with the OAuth provider ID from step 3a
   - Replace `<your-ngrok-url>` with the ngrok URL from step 2

<details>
<summary>Slack App Manifest</summary>

```json
{
    "display_information": {
        "name": "Open SWE",
        "description": "Enables Open SWE to interact with your workspace",
        "background_color": "#000000"
    },
    "features": {
        "app_home": {
            "home_tab_enabled": false,

            "display_name": "Open SWE",
            "always_online": true
        }
    },
    "oauth_config": {
        "redirect_urls": [
            "https://smith.langchain.com/host-oauth-callback/<your-provider-id>"
        ],
        "scopes": {
            "bot": [

                "team:read",
                "users:read",
                "users:read.email"
            ]
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "event_subscriptions": {
            "request_url": "https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/slack",
            "bot_events": [
                "app_mention",
                "message.im",
                "message.mpim"
            ]
        },
        "org_deploy_enabled": false,
        "socket_mode_enabled": false,
        "token_rotation_enabled": false
    }
}
```

</details>

3. Install the app to your workspace and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`)

**Credentials you'll need:**

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: the Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: found under **Basic Information → App Credentials**
- `SLACK_BOT_USER_ID`: the bot's user ID (find it in Slack by clicking the bot's profile)
- `SLACK_BOT_USERNAME`: the bot's display name (e.g. `open-swe`)

**Default repo:**

Slack messages are routed to the default repo (`DEFAULT_REPO_OWNER`/`DEFAULT_REPO_NAME` — see step 6) unless the user specifies one with `repo:owner/name` in their message.

## 6. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. Below is the full list — only fill in the sections relevant to the triggers you configured.

```bash

```

## 7. Start the server

Make sure ngrok is still running from step 2, then start the LangGraph server in a second terminal:

```bash
uv run langgraph dev --no-browser
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:2024` with these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /webhooks/github` | GitHub issue/PR/comment webhooks |
| `POST /webhooks/linear` | Linear comment webhooks |
| `GET /webhooks/linear` | Linear webhook verification |
| `POST /webhooks/slack` | Slack event webhooks |
| `GET /webhooks/slack` | Slack webhook verification |
| `GET /health` | Health check |

## 8. Verify it works

### GitHub

1. Go to any issue in a repository where the app is installed
2. Create or comment on an issue with: `@openswe what files are in this repo?`
3. You should see:
   - A 👀 reaction on your comment within a few seconds
   - A new run in your LangSmith project
   - The agent replies with a comment on the issue

### Linear

1. Go to any Linear issue in a team you configured in `LINEAR_TEAM_TO_REPO`
2. Add a comment: `@openswe what files are in this repo?`
3. You should see:
   - A 👀 reaction on your comment within a few seconds
   - A new run in your LangSmith project
   - The agent replies with a comment on the issue

### Slack

1. In any channel where the bot is invited, start a thread
2. Mention the bot: `@open-swe what's in the repo?`
3. You should see:
   - An 👀 reaction on your message
   - A reply in the thread with the agent's response

## 9. Production deployment

For production, deploy the agent on [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/) instead of running locally:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect the repo to LangGraph Cloud
3. Set all environment variables from step 6 in the deployment config
4. Update your webhook URLs (Linear, Slack, GitHub App) to point to your production URL (replace the ngrok URL)

The `langgraph.json` at the project root already defines the graph entry point and HTTP app:

```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "agent.server:get_agent"
  },
  "http": {
    "app": "agent.webapp:app"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving events

- Verify ngrok is running and the URL matches what's configured in GitHub/Linear/Slack
- Check the ngrok web inspector at `http://localhost:4040` for incoming requests
- Ensure you enabled the correct event types (Comments → Create for Linear, `app_mention` for Slack, Issues + Issue comment for GitHub)
- **Webhook secrets are required** — if `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, or `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is not set, all requests to that endpoint will be rejected with 401

### GitHub authentication errors

- Verify `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` are set correctly
- Ensure the GitHub App is installed on the target repositories
- Check that the private key includes the full `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines

### Sandbox creation failures

- Verify `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD` is set and valid
- Check LangSmith sandbox quotas in your workspace settings
- If the server refuses to start with `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT_ID must be set`, build a snapshot (see step 4c) and export its UUID
- If you see `Failed to create sandbox from snapshot '<id>'`, confirm the snapshot exists in your workspace and has status `ready`
- If you get a 403 Forbidden error on the sandbox endpoints, your LangSmith workspace may not have sandbox access enabled — contact LangSmith support

### Agent not responding to comments

- For GitHub: ensure the comment or issue contains `@openswe` (case-insensitive), and the commenter's GitHub username is in `GITHUB_USER_EMAIL_MAP`
- For Linear: ensure the comment contains `@openswe` (case-insensitive)
- For Slack: ensure the bot is invited to the channel and the message is an `@mention`
- Check server logs for webhook processing errors

### Token encryption errors

- Ensure `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- The key must be a valid 32-byte Fernet-compatible base64 string
